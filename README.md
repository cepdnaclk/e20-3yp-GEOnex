## Database Structure - MongoDB ER Model

### Overview

This project utilizes a MongoDB-based NoSQL database optimized for a document-oriented approach. The system efficiently manages Users, Projects, Points, and Devices by leveraging references between collections and embedding where appropriate to ensure scalability and flexibility.
        Users and Projects â†’ Referenced using User_Id
        Projects and Points â†’ Referenced using Project_Id
        Projects and Devices â†’ Devices are embedded inside Projects

### Database Schema Design
#### User Collection

Each User document contains essential details. Projects are stored separately and referenced using User_Id.

```
{
  "User_Id": 1,
  "Email": "user@example.com",
  "Password": "hashed_password",
  "Role": "admin",
  "Created_At": "2024-02-22",
  "Last_Login": "2024-02-23"
}

```
#### Project Collection (Referenced from User)
Each Project is stored separately and references a User_Id. The Devices used in a project are embedded inside the document
```
{
  "Project_Id": 101,
  "User_Id": 1,  // Reference to User collection
  "Name": "Project 1",
  "Created_On": "2024-02-20",
  "Last_Modified": "2024-02-22",
  "Status": "Completed",
  "Survey_Time": "12:00:00",
  "Description": "Road surver day-1",
  "Total_Points": 100,
  "Devices": [
    {
      "Name": "Device A",
      "Status": "Online",
      "Type": "Base",
      "Battery_Percentage": 90,
      "Signal_Strength": "Good",
      "Last_Update": "2024-02-22",
      "Hardware_Id": 301
    }
  ]  // Embedded devices
}
```

#### Point Collection (Referenced from Project)
Each Point represents a geographic location where survey data is collected. Instead of being embedded, each Point document references a Project_Id.
```
{
  "Point_Id": 5001,
  "Project_Id": 101,  // Reference to Project collection
  "Name": "Location 1",
  "Type": "Sensor Data",
  "Latitude": 45.1234,
  "Longitude": 93.1234,
  "Survey_Id": 25,
  "Accuracy": 1.5,
  "Timestamp": "12:05:00"
}

```

#### Device (Embedded in Project)
Devices are embedded inside Projects because they are tightly coupled with them, reducing unnecessary joins.
```
{
  "Name": "Device A",
  "Status": "Online",
  "Type": "Base",
  "Battery_Percentage": 90,
  "Signal_Strength": "Good",
  "Last_Update": "2024-02-22",
  "Hardware_Id": 301
}
```
